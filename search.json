In industry, I’ve led applied AI and GenAI delivery as an AI researcher/consultant at RISE, and as an interim team lead for Data Science & Advanced Analytics at a global industrial manufacturer.\nAt RISE, I led Vinnova-funded applied AI projects (project lead, ~9M SEK) and contributed as AI lead to EU initiatives (~2M SEK), delivering pilot-ready systems and public artifacts.\nAcross engagements, I focus on shipping systems that create measurable impact — including 40% faster inspection workflows, 50%+ lower data collection costs via synthetic data, and 90% lower hardware costs for industrial edge AI."

    "text": "Why this company exists\nMost AI initiatives fail for predictable reasons: poor evaluation setup, underestimating data readiness, and a gap between prototypes and production. InertialRange exists to remove those failure modes with a focus on early-stage evaluation, clear scope, and delivery-oriented execution.\nRunning my own company also lets me choose the right roles and engagements — the ones where I can take real ownership and deliver outcomes."
