## Founder

InertialRange Labs AB is a AI consulting practice run by Farrukh Nauman.

I have a PhD in Computational Astrophysics (University of Rochester) and held research roles at the Niels Bohr Institute and Chalmers University of Technology. In industry, I’ve led applied AI and GenAI delivery as an AI researcher/consultant at RISE, and as an interim team lead for Data Science & Advanced Analytics at a global industrial manufacturer.

At RISE, I led Vinnova-funded applied AI projects (project lead, ~9M SEK) and contributed as AI lead to EU initiatives (~2M SEK), delivering pilot-ready systems and public artifacts.

Across engagements, I focus on shipping systems that create measurable impact — including 40% faster inspection workflows, 50%+ lower data collection costs via synthetic data, and 90% lower hardware costs for industrial edge AI.

## Why this company exists

Most AI initiatives fail for predictable reasons: poor evaluation setup, underestimating data readiness, and a gap between prototypes and production. InertialRange exists to remove those failure modes with a focus on early-stage evaluation, clear scope, and delivery-oriented execution.

Running my own company also lets me choose the right roles and engagements — the ones where I can take real ownership and deliver outcomes.
